# Building a Cell

The project we will be doing during this course is not a lightweight
task. Our goal will be to create a model that is able to simulate a
whole yeast cell in all its complexity. Naturally we will fail
miserably in the complete reconstruction, but we will hopefully learn
how to do it in principle and lay the groundwork for an extendable
virtual cell.

This project is inspired by the first steps taken towards modelling a
whole cell by [Karr et
al.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412007763).

We provided a minimal simulation framework for you to simplify
distribution of the work into subgroups and enable us to simulate the
model with different building blocks.

You should form groups of two students to work on one of the
subprojects and use `git` to integrate your work with the other
groups. Look into the
[wiki](https://github.com/tbphu/fachkurs_2016_project/wiki/) for more
details on the proposed subprojects.
